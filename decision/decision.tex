\begin{abstract}
Probabilistic inference at its best gives probabilistic information
about parameters and models.  In many cases of importance---as with
experimental design or purchasing or delivery of results---it is
necessary to make a hard decision or choice.  It is almost never the
right move to choose the most probable model or option; it is rare
that the most probable is the option that delivers the most benefit to
the decider.  Instead the decider ought to specify a utility function
and work to optimize expected utility, or minimize expected loss, or
minimize maximal loss.  In real-world situations of building
experiments or operating an organization, to be generally useful the
utility must be specified in (the equivalent of) currency (dollar)
units.  Whether the decision is about which observation to make next,
which of several hypotheses to reject, or which of very different
research programs to pursue, the employed utility function should be
an approximation to the decider's \emph{long-term future discounted
  free cash flow}.

Likelihood ratios

False-positive and false-negative rates

plausibility and discovery

\section{Money must be involved}

Back in 2005-ish, the cosmology community underwent a soul-searching
exercise about future projects intended to investigate the nature of
\emph{dark energy}, or the mechanical cause of the late-time
acceleration of the Universe's expansion.  The Dark-Energy Task
Force (DETF) ended up recommending that projects be ranked on the
basis of their ability to constrain two dark-energy parameters, $w_0$
and $w_a$.  In particular, they argued that the relevant scalar or
utility or figure of merit (FoM) to consider is the inverse of the
area inside the 95-percent confidence interval (implicitly a
likelihood contour) in the $w_0$--$w_a$ plane.\note{\cite{detf}.}

In many ways this was a breakthrough: A committee recommends a
quantitative method for comparing (necessarily expensive, complex, and
lengthy) projects, and describes that quantitative method in terms of
merit or utility.  Furthermore, the proposed FoM scalar relates to the
informaton content in the data delivered by the experiments, so it is
eminently sensible.

However, there is an equally valid point of view in which this
recommendation was \emph{useless}.  The reason is that although the
FoM permits the community to compare projects in terms of information
delivered about dark energy, no two projects deliver the same FoM, no
two projects have the same total cost, and no two projects deliver
results at the same point in the future.  If one project delivers an
FoM of 1200, costs $8\times 10^6$~USD, and takes three years, and
another delivers an FoM of 1950 and costs $17\times 10^6$~USD, and
takes 2.5 years, how are we to compare them?  We need to be able to
understand the trade-offs between money, FoM, and time.  And sure
enough, although the DETF was able to classify projects into
categories (FoM bins), it was not able to rank the relative value of
very qualitatively different projects.
