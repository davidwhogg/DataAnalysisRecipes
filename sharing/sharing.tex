\section{Economic pragmatism}

LTFDFCF.

Going to treat data and code in parallel for most of what follows.

\section{Overview}

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{@{}p{0.48\textwidth}|p{0.48\textwidth}@{}} % note @{} entries to remove space on edges
\multicolumn{1}{c}{costs} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{benefits} \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{c}{releasing data} \\ \hline
this & that \\
the other & whatever \\
etc & ibid \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{c}{open-sourcing code} \\ \hline
foo & bar \\ 
what & who \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Summary of costs and benefits. Each of these is discussed in
  the main text.\label{tab:summary}}
\end{table}

\section{Personal considerations}

Search! Hosting! Preservation!

Documentation burden (bad). Documentation pressure (good).

Exposure of the horror (bad). Encouragement to be less horrible (good).

\section{Team considerations}

\section{Ethical considerations}

You might expect me here to go all ``ethically, you must release your
data!''; I won't, because there are many situations in which it is in
fact \emph{unethical} to release data and code.

Coming back to the personal point about exposing the horror and
requirements to document: Both of these have ethical aspects: The more
we expose the horror, the more we make people comfortable with
sharing. The more we document, the more we help others with
reproducibility and with new science.

\section{Licensing}

Open-sourcing your code means more than just publishing it.

Licensing has not really been explored for data, at least not in most
scientific domains.
