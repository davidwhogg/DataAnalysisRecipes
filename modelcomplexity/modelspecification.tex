\begin{abstract}
  All the inference in this series of \documentname s involves
  probabilistic comparison of models and data.  Here we lay out our
  specific meaning of the word ``model''; the short summary is that a
  model is an approximate (\emph{always} approximate) but justified
  expression for (something proportional to) the probability of the
  data, usually as a function of model parameters.  This is also
  called a ``likelihood function'' in many contexts.  Importantly in
  the physical sciences, likelihood function specification requires a
  quantitative description of the noise contributing to the data.
  Additional power comes to models in which it is possible to specify
  a prior probability density function over the parameters, and
  especially the \emph{nuisance} parameters; this power comes at the
  cost of the additional assumptions.  Many things conventionally
  described as ``models'' do not meet the criteria outlined here.
